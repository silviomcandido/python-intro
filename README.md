# Python Programming Introduction for Engineers

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as an introduction to Python programming, with a particular focus on applications in engineering.

## Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

- Python Basics: Variables, Data Types, Control Structures
- Functions and Lambda Functions
- File Input/Output
- NumPy and SciPy for numerical computing
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Pandas for data analysis

## Usage

To use the notebook, you will need to have Python installed, preferably through the [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). You will also need to have the following Python packages installed:

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas

You can install these packages using pip:

```
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib pandas
```

Once Python and the necessary packages are installed, you can clone this repository and navigate to the downloaded directory. From there, you can start Jupyter by running the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook
```

This will open the Jupyter interface in your web browser, and you can open the notebook from there.
